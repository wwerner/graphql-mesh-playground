# GraphQL Mesh Playground

Experimenting with various sources for GraphQL Mesh. Just a place for me to try
out things and reproduce issues.

Play around w/ `.meshrc.yml` & the versions in `package.json`.

You might want to use the [redocly CLI](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli) to validate OpenAPI specs,

To start, run `DEBUG=1 yarn mesh dev``
